#### Status
cb-replicate is one of our Labs projects, and it's not-supported under our enterprise support agreements.

It's a handy developer tool, but it's pre-release, not formally tested, and is not considered production ready. Don't rely on it for any business-critical tasks.

If you do encounter issues, please [submit a Github issue](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/cb-replicate/issues/new).
